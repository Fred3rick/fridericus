# Fridericus - Your personal space on the web

Fridericus is a continuously developing wordpress theme, very useful for starting to learn the basics of a classic wordpress theme. It is very simple and structured with the implementation of the famous bootstrap framework in its third version.

The theme in its entirety has a section for:
- a short description
- communicate your skills
- a carousel where to exhibit your work
- a very simple contact form
- and much more...
